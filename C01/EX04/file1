They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul.

And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?

Mark’d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,
It launch’d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,
Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them …
